ATOM 
Overview 
The ATOM records present the atomic coordinates for standard residues. They also 
present the occupancy and temperature factor for each atom. Heterogen 
coordinates use the HETATM record type. The element symbol is always present on 
each ATOM record; segment identifier and charge are optional.

Details 
* ATOM records for proteins are listed from amino to carboxyl terminus. 
* Nucleic acid residues are listed from the 5' to the 3' terminus. 
* No ordering is specified for polysaccharides. 
* The list of ATOM records in a chain is terminated by a TER record. 
* If more than one model is present in the entry, each model is delimited by 
MODEL and ENDMDL records. 
* For more information on atom naming conventions, see Appendix 3, and for 
residue names, see Appendix 4 and the HET section of this document 
* If an atom is provided in more than one position, then a non-blank alternate 
location indicator must be used as the alternate location indicator for each of 
the positions. Within a residue all atoms that are associated with each other in 
a given conformation are assigned the same alternate position indicator. 
* For atoms that are in alternate sites indicated by the alternate site 
indicator, sorting of atoms in the ATOM/HETATM list uses the following general 
rules: 
  - In the simple case that involves a few atoms or a few residues with 
  alternate sites, the coordinates occur one after the other in the entry. 
  - In the case of a whole macromolecular chain, or significant portion of a 
  chain, having alternate sites, the atoms for each alternate position are 
  listed together. The two conformers are delineated by MODEL/ENDMDL records. In 
  this case each MODEL must represent the entire molecular assemblage, including 
  any heterogen group which is not necessarily disordered. Such is the case when 
  DNA molecules are placed in UP and DOWN positions. 
  - In the case of a large heterogen groups which are disordered, the atoms for 
  each conformer are listed together. The two lists are not separated by 
  MODEL/ENDMDL as is done for macromolecular chains. 
* Addition of atoms to side chains of standard residues are handled as follows: 
  The additional atoms (modifying group) are represented as a HET group which is 
  assigned its own residue name. The chainID, sequence number, and insertion 
  code assigned to the HET group is that of the standard residue to which it is 
  attached. 
* Chemical modifications of standard residue side chains by addition of new 
atoms are handled as follows: 
  - The new atoms are represented as a HET group. This group is assigned the 
  chain name, sequence number, and insertion code of the standard residue that 
  it modifies. 
  - The atoms comprising these het groups are listed as HETATM and are inserted 
  in the ATOM list immediately after the TER record of the chain. These groups 
  are listed in the same order as the standard residue to which they are bonded 
  (i.e., from the N- to C-terminus for polypeptides and from the 5' to 3' end 
  for nucleic acids). 
  - Modified standard residues and the modifying het group may be assigned the 
  same SEGID to further describe the relationship between the groups. PDB will 
  use this mechanism only if SEGID's were not assigned to these atoms for other 
  purposes. 
  - Modified standard residues must have a corresponding MODRES record. 
* The insertion code is commonly used in sequence numbering and is described 
here. In most cases, the amino acids that comprise a protein are numbered 
sequentially starting with 1. However, there are a number of situations that may 
give rise to different numbering schemes: 
  - Homologous proteins can exist in a number of different species. Depositors 
  may use a residue numbering scheme in order to preserve the homology. The 
  reference protein may be numbered sequentially starting with 1, then the 
  homologous protein from another species aligned to it. If residues are not 
  present in the homologous sequence, residue numbers may be skipped so that 
  alignment can be preserved. If additional residues are present relative to the 
  reference protein, they may have a letter, called an insertion code, appended 
  to the sequence number. Negative numbers and zeros are permitted if they are 
  needed to align the N-terminus.

  - The numbering of a proenzyme may be used for the enzyme following cleavage. 
  - The molecule studied might be a portion of the whole protein. The residue 
  numbering scheme could show the relationship to the intact protein. 
  - The protein might be a mutant with residues inserted and deleted. As above, 
  the residue numbering of the native protein could be preserved by appropriate 
  use of gaps in the numbering and/or insertion codes. 
  - The nucleic acid community generally numbers structures sequentially. For 
  double-stranded nucleic acids, entries usually use two different chain 
  identifiers. For example, an octameric duplex would be numbered 1 - 8 for 
  chain A, and 9 - 16 for chain B. 
* If the depositor provides the data, then the isotropic B value is given for 
the temperature factor. 
* If there is no isotropic B value from the depositor, but there is an ANISOU 
record with anisotropic temperature factors, then the B equivalent is stored in 
the tempFactor field, as calculated by: 
  B(eq) = 8pi**2{1/3[U(1,1) + U(2,2) + U(3,3)]} 
  - This will obviate the need to check if ANISOU records are present before 
  interpreting the contents of the temperature factor field. 
  - In some previously released PDB entries with anisotropic temperature factors 
  provided as ANISOU records, the temperature factor field of the corresponding 
  ATOM or HETATM record contained the equivalent U-isotropic [U(eq)] which is 
  calculated by: 
  U(eq) = 1/3[U(1,1) + U(2,2) + U(3,3)] x 10**-4 
* If there are neither isotropic B values from the depositor, nor anisotropic 
temperature factors in ANISOU, then the default value of 0.0 is used for the 
temperature factor. 
* In some entries, the occupancy and temperature factor fields are used for 
other quantities. In these cases, an explanation is provided in the remarks. 
* Columns 73 - 76 identify specific segments of the molecule. The segment id is 
a string of up to four (4) alphanumeric characters, left-justified, and may 
include a space, e.g., CH86, A 1, NASE. The segment itself may consist of a 
complete chain or a portion of a chain. The importance of this new field can be 
appreciated if one considers an antibody structure having two molecules in the 
asymmetric unit. Since each chain must have a unique chain identifier, the two 
heavy chains and two light chains cannot currently be labeled to indicate their 
nature. Segment id's of CH, VH1, VH2, VH3, CL, and VL would clearly identify 
regions of the chains and the relationship between them. Users of X-PLOR will be 
familiar with SEGID as used in the refinement application of X-PLOR. 
* Columns 77 - 78 contain the atom's element symbol (as given in the periodic 
table), right-justified. This is especially needed because in some cases it has 
not been possible to follow the convention that columns 13 - 14 of the atom name 
contain the element symbol. The most common cases are: 
  - In large het groups it sometimes is not possible to follow the convention of 
  having the first two characters be the chemical symbol and still use atom 
  names that are meaningful to users. A example is nicotinamide adenine 
  dinucleotide, atom names begin with an A or N, depending on which portion of 
  the molecule they appear in, e.g., AC6 or NC6, AN1 or NN1. 
  - Hydrogen naming sometimes conflicts with IUPAC conventions. For example, a 
  hydrogen named HG11 in columns 13 - 16 is differentiated from a mercury atom 
  by the element symbol in columns 77 - 78. Columns 13 - 16 present a unique 
  name for each atom. 
* Columns 79 - 80 indicate any charge on the atom, e.g., 2+, 1-. In most cases 
these are blank. 
Verification/Validation/Value Authority Control 
PDB checks ATOM/HETATM records for PDB format, sequence information, and 
packing. The PDB reserves the right to return deposited coordinates to the 
author for transformation into PDB format. 
PDB intends to verify the coordinates against the experimental structure factor 
data in the when available. Details on this will be forthcoming. 
Relationships to Other Record Types 
The ATOM records are compared to the corresponding sequence database. Residue 
discrepancies appear in the SEQADV record. Missing atoms are annotated in the 
remarks. HETATM records are formatted in the same way as ATOM records. The 
sequence implied by ATOM records must be identical to that given in SEQRES, with 
the exception that residues that have no coordinates, e.g., due to disorder, 
must appear in SEQRES. Remark 550 is used to describe the meaning assigned to 
any segment identifiers used.

Known Problems 
Due to the ever-increasing size of protein structures in the PDB, the atom 
serial number field may soon need to be increased. An increase of one column 
will allow for cases where entries have more than 99,999 atoms. Only 5 digits 
are available for the atom serial number, but some structures have already been 
received with more that 99,999 atoms. 
No distinction is made between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides in the SEQRES 
records. These residues are identified with the same residue name (i.e., A, C, 
G, T, U).
