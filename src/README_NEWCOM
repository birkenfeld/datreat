Newcom test:

gfortran -o a.out os_utils.F90 new_com.F90 linenoise.o linenoise_f90.o newcom_example.f90


modification compared to drspine:

private variables in new_com made public because of the legacy sections in datreat

use Makefile_new..


many changes concerning iout etc. --> better separation

some changes in new_com.F90 
(i.e. quit response)


we had to change decode in datreat_subs form & as cmd sing to _ as cmd sign.

makro path etc. muss noch gesetzt werden...
