add_help_to_th.f90 
th_template_generator.f90

To use them compile with any modern fortran compiler
e.g 
gfortran -o th_template_generator th_template_generator.f90
gfortran -o add_help_to_th        add_help_to_th.f90

Then:
1. to include more help info into an already available theory

add_help_to_th < th_theory.f90 > out.f90

check out.f90 insert the additional comments and help texts at the
marked positions and then replace th_theory.f90 in /theos by out.f90 


2. to create a new theory in a standardized way with all features

 a.) Make a th_template according to the example: template1
 b.) th_template_generator < th_template
 c.) find out.f90 generated 
 d.) complete out.f90 by editing (you need at least to
     fix the line containing
     th_theoryname = !INSERT RESULT ......

 e.) copy with the approriate name to /theos



------------------
in both cases one needs a make to activate theories
